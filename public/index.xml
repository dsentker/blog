      <description>Recently I saw a video about the Weirdest Linux Bug Ever Discovered. In short, the problem was that printing was not possible in some cases. At first it wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely clear what the problem could be. A driver? The software? The printer? The issue was that the error did not seem to be reproducible. Sometimes printing worked, sometimes it didn&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Hey Dev, can you help me with the printer?&amp;rdquo; Since several users had the same problem, it had to be a bug.</description>
