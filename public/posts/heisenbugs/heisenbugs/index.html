      <p>Recently I saw a video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6fPfwixNLk">the Weirdest Linux Bug Ever Discovered</a>.
In short, the problem is that printing was not possible in some cases. At first it wasn&rsquo;t entirely clear what the
problem could be. A driver? The software? The printer? The problem here was that the error did not seem to be
reproducible. Sometimes printing worked, sometimes it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id="hey-dev-can-you-help-me-with-the-printer">&ldquo;Hey Dev, can you help me with the printer?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Since several users had the same problem, it <em>had</em> to be a bug. However, it was not reliably reproducible.
At least not at first glance. The wife of a developer came across a first clue, apparently by chance: the problems only
occurred on a Tuesday. This is typically the moment that electrifies every developer.
Progress! A narrowing-down of the chain of events. A reproducible error.
As we all know, this is the first (and most important) step in fixing a bug.</p>
<p>What the video did get me to do, however, is to write about how difficult it can be to identify bugs. Bugs that are
difficult (or impossible) to reproduce are sometimes called <strong>Heisenbugs</strong>. I like that term.</p>
